    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        AI Resume is an Android application developed by an independent student developer.
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how information is
        collected, used, stored, and protected when you use the AI Resume application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The app collects information only when users voluntarily provide it, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full Name</li>
        <li>Email Address</li>
        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>GitHub Profile Link</li>
        <li>LinkedIn Profile Link</li>
        <li>Portfolio Link</li>
        <li>Education Details</li>
        <li>Skills</li>
        <li>Work Experience</li>
        <li>Projects</li>
        <li>Achievements</li>
        <li>Courses / Certifications</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        AI Resume uses Google Sign-In for authentication. When signing in, Google provides
        basic profile information such as email address and a unique user ID, which is
        used only to identify your account within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create, edit, and manage resumes</li>
        <li>Generate resume content using AI</li>
        <li>Allow downloading and sharing resumes as PDF files</li>
        <li>Maintain app functionality and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share personal information with third
        parties for marketing or commercial purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        User data is stored using Google Firebase services, including Firestore and
        Firebase Storage. All data transfers between the app and Firebase services are
        protected using secure HTTPS (TLS) encryption.
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
        While industry-standard security measures are used, no method of electronic
        storage or transmission is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be
        guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
    Users can delete resumes from within the app interface. Please note that deleted
    resumes may not be immediately removed from backend storage and may be retained
    for operational or maintenance purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Users may also request complete account and data deletion by visiting our
    <a href="/delete-account" target="_blank">Delete Account page</a>.
</p>


    <h2>AI Content Generation</h2>
    <p>
        AI Resume uses the Gemini AI API to generate resume content based on the information
        entered by the user. Only resume-related text is sent to the AI service for the
        purpose of generating content.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        The app displays advertisements using Google AdMob, including banner and
        interstitial ads. AdMob may use device identifiers (such as Advertising ID) to
        provide and improve advertising services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal resume data and content are <strong>not</strong> shared with advertisers.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        AI Resume relies on third-party services that may collect information in accordance
        with their own privacy policies, including:
    </p>

        </a>
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        AI Resume is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
